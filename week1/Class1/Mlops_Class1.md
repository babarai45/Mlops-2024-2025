# Wellcome to Mlops Class1
## Agenda
- Introduction to Mlops
- Introduction to Devops

## Introduction to Mlops
- Mlops is a combination of Machine Learning and Devops.
- Mlops stands for Machine Learning Operations.
- MLops is set of practies to design, build, deploy, and manage machine learning models in production consistently, reliably and efficiently.
- Mlops is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage the production ML lifecycle.

## Life Cycle of Mlops
- Data Collection
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Building
- Model Training
- Model Testing
- Model Deployment
- Model Monitoring
- Model Optimization
- Model Re-Training
- Model Decommissioning

# Mlops vs Data Science
- Data Science is a process of deriving insights from the data. 
- Mlops is a process of deploying the model in production. 
- Data Science is a process of building the model.
- Mlops is a process of managing the model in production.

## Introduction to Devops
- Devops is a combination of Development and Operations.
- Devops is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations.
- Devops aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
- Devops helps to increase the speed of delivering applications and services.
- Devops helps to improve the collaboration between the development and operations teams.
- Devops helps to automate the process of software development.
- Devops helps to monitor the performance of the application.
- Devops helps to manage the infrastructure of the application.
- Devops helps to manage the security of the application.

## Life Cycle of Devops
- Development
- Testing
- Integration
- Deployment
- Monitoring
- Feedback
- Planning
- Collaboration
- Automation
